The aircraft is 20% more fuel efficient than similar sized commercial jets it is designed to replace, and to date, is Boeing's most fuel efficient aircraft. Composite materials make up 50 percent of the primary structure, including the fuselage and wing. The engine nacelles are made of serrated edges that reduce the noise levels both outside and inside the cabin, by up to 60%. The aircraft also features raked wingtip to further improve the fuel efficiency. The windows are more than 30 percent larger than those on most similarly sized airplanes. Instead of pulling shades up and down, customers can adjust the brightness of windows with a button. Using an electrochromic dimming system, the windows turn from fully transparent to completely dimmed in gradual steps.", 250000000, "Images/thumbnails/products/Boeing787.png", "Models/Boeing787/", "Boeing_787_8.obj", "Boeing_787_8.mtl", 1));
